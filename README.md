Node.JS library Encrypted Smiley Â® Secure Protocol (eSSP, SSP)

**Supported devices:** NV9USB, NV10USB, BV20, BV50, BV100, NV200, SMART Hopper, SMART Payout, NV11

```js
const sspLib = require('encrypted-smiley-secure-protocol')

let eSSP = new sspLib({
  id: 0x00,
  debug: false,
  timeout: 3000,
  fixedKey: '0123456701234567',
})
```

## Methods

All methods use Promise

- `eSSP.open('COM1')` - Connect device
- `eSSP.close()` - Disconnect device
- `eSSP.initEncryption()` - Initializing Diffie-Hellman key exchange and enable encryption
- `eSSP.enable()` - Enable device and start listen events
- `eSSP.disable()` - Disable device and stop listen events
- `eSSP.command('COMMAND_NAME')` - Execute command and get answer

## Command

```js
eSSP.command('GET_SERIAL_NUMBER').then(result => {
  console.log('Serial number:', result.info.serial_number)
  return
})
```

See [all supported commands](#supported-commands)

## Event

```js
eSSP.on('READ_NOTE', result => {
  console.log(result)
})
```

See [all supported events](#supported-events)

## Example

```js
const sspLib = require('encrypted-smiley-secure-protocol')

let eSSP = new sspLib({
  id: 0,
  debug: false,
  timeout: 3000,
  fixedKey: '0123456701234567',
})

eSSP.on('OPEN', () => {
  console.log('open')

  eSSP
    .command('SYNC')
    .then(() => eSSP.command('HOST_PROTOCOL_VERSION', { version: 6 }))
    .then(() => eSSP.initEncryption())
    .then(() => eSSP.command('GET_SERIAL_NUMBER'))
    .then(result => {
      console.log('SERIAL NUMBER:', result.info.serial_number)
      return
    })
    .then(() => eSSP.enable())
    .then(result => {
      if (result.status == 'OK') {
        console.log('Device is active')
      }
      return
    })
})

eSSP.on('NOTE_REJECTED', result => {
  console.log('NOTE_REJECTED', result)

  eSSP.command('LAST_REJECT_CODE').then(result => {
